\usage{
getConnections2(events)
}
\arguments{
\item{events}{A data.table object returned by \code{readEvents()} function.}
}
\value{
A matrix object with the antenna IDs where devices are connected for every time instants in the events file.
If a device is not connected to any antenna at a time instant, the corresponding element in the matrix will have the
value NA.
}
\description{
Builds a matrix object containing the IDs of the antennas to which devices are connected.
The number of rows equals the number of devices and the number of columns equals the number of time instants
when the network events were recorded. An element \code{[i,j]} in the returned matrix equals the ID of the antenna
where the mobile device with index \code{i} in the ordered list of device IDs (returned by \code{getDeviceIDs()}) is
conntected at the time instant with index \code{j} in the sequence of time instants when the network events
where recorded.
